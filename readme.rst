mocktest
********
... is a powerful and easy-to-use mocking library, inspired by rspec and
similar in some ways to Michael Foord's popular Mock module.

The main features are:

 - expressive DSL for specifying expectations, stubs and replacement objects
 - powerful expectation matching behaviour for mock objects
 - automatic verification of expectations (before each test's tearDown)
 - automatic rollback of inserted mock objects after each test
 - descriptive error messages when something fails


It's released under the GPLv3 licence (see the LICENCE file).
